## Getting it up and ready

Note: the project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

* Install all the required packages with `pnpm install`.
* Create a `.env` based on the template.
* Use `pnpm prisma db push` and `pnpm prisma generate` to get your database and client ready to go!
* Run `pnpm run api` to start the API server and `pnpm start` to start the web app server.
